print("Let's play!")

# we invoke (use) the "input" function
# which is built into Python
myName = input("What's your name player 1?")

# we concatenate together the words "welcome"
# with the player's name
print("Welcome " + myName)

# question: How does one run Python
# code/script inside of a Bash script?

# question: In contrast to a "strongly typed"
# language such as C#, how does Python assign
# types to its variables? --> dynamically,
# it's taken care of for you, you don't have to
# specify
